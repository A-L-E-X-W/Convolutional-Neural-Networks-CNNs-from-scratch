### Introduction

This project demonstrates how to build and train CNN models from scratch using PyTorch. It explores various architectures, including custom EfficientNet-inspired and Inception-inspired models.

### Dataset

The models are trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of:

- 60,000 images (32x32 pixels, RGB)

- 10 classes (e.g., airplane, car, bird, cat)

- Split:

    - Training: 50,000 images

    - Test: 10,000 images
